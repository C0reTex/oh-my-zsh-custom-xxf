Yet another [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) custom theme. 

Currently the only thing is a theme file for terminal prompt.

---

### How to:

After your [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) and [OMZ](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) are ready.

Save and copy the theme file into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/`. (You should keep the file name and it's extension as `xxf.zsh-theme`)


Use your favorite editor to open the file `~/.zshrc`

Find and change the value of `SH_THEME` to `"xxf"`. Just like this:

```sh
ZSH_THEME="xxf"
```

Save the file and open a new terminal. That's it!

If everything ok, the result will be:
